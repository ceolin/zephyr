properties:
    wakeup-source:
      required: false
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Property to identify that a device can be used as wake up source.

        When this property is provided a specific flag is set into the
        device that tells the system that the device is capable of
        wake up the system.

        Wake up capable devices are disabled (interruptions will not wake up
        the system) by default but they can be enabled at runtime if necessary.

    wakeup-constraints:
       type: phandles
       required: false
       description: |

         List of power management states which the device can not operate as
         wake up source. The pm subsystem will automatically set consraints
         in these states when the device is used as wake up source.
